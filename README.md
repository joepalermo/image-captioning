# Image Captioning
Experiments in image captioning. 


### MNIST Sequences
Classify MNIST sequences with a hybrid CNN-RNN architecture implemented in Pytorch. 
The architecture used comes from the Show-and-Tell paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555). 
This work was done jointly with Will Turner (https://github.com/petosegan) at the Recurse Center 
(https://www.recurse.com/).
