### MNIST Sequences
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Classify MNIST sequences with a hybrid CNN-RNN architecture implemented in Pytorch.
The architecture used comes from the Show-and-Tell paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555).
Initial implementation written jointly with Will Turner (https://github.com/petosegan) at the Recurse Center (https://www.recurse.com/).
